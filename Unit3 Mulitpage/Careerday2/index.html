    <h1>Coach: a person who teaches and trains an athlete or performer.</h1>
    <h2>A coach needs experience in the main sport they are coaching.</h2>
    <p>I want to be a coach for the lions because it sounds fun. The reason it sounds fun is because you get to work and talk about football as your job. I'd love to be able to communicate with the players and staff. </p>
